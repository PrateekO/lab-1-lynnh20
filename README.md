tips to working with git and github

Name: Lynn Huang

What do you tell people about your field of study at a party: Stats isn't for everyone but I love it :)

Three main activities you've been doing at work/study:
1. Meeting for group projects
2. Working at Kingland
3. Not getting enough sleep


Important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work?
1. I make folders on my personal laptop for each class I take.
2. Naming files after what's in them to make them easy to find.
3. I try to organize my workload by prioritizing the things I find the easiest.
